# futaba-vfd
This project is based upon the [nervus/FutubaVFD](https://github.com/nervus/FutabaVFD) Arduino project, bringing it to the Raspberry Pi.

It is built upon the [rust-embedded/rust-sysfs-gpio](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-sysfs-gpio) library, and aims to be just as easy to use.

The library is currently under development, more information will be posted here when ready.
